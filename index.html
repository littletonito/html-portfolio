    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I am a 34 year old male from Virginia. I currently work full time for the fire department as a firefighter and EMT. I love to help people and this job allows me to reach out to the people who are in need. I realy enjoy the job and everything that comes wth it. All firefighter jobs in the United States have a distinct and unique schedule, we call it shift work.Due to this schedule, I have a lot of free time so I decided to keep growing as a person by bettering myself and learning new skills such as web developing.
