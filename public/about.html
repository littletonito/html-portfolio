<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a 34 year old male who lives in Virginia, USA. I believe to have an adventurous spirit, which is why I like to explore. I'm a full time firefighter and EMT, and due to this job and its schedule I have a lot of free time. I'm learning this new web developing skill because I believe i always growing in different aspects of your life. That is the only way to become better, by exposing yourself to new challenges in all aspects of your life. </p>
